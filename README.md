This is a Todo App built on Todo components.
Use TodosContext to store and update the todos.
Implement TodoApp component with an input field to create new todos on submit (Enter). Each item should have:
id - unique identifier (+new Date() is good enough)
title - the text of a todo
completed - current status (false by default)
Show the number of not completed todos in TodoApp;
